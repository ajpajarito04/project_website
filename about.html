        <h1>About the business</h1><br>
        <p>Stove n’ Oven is owned and managed by Ms. Janelyn Dalupan.</p><br>
        <h1>History of the Business</h1><br>
        <p>Stove n’ Oven - was established in 2020, during the pandemic, when almost all establishment and most companies were closed and only food and logistics businesses were left in operation since food is an essential need during that time and logistics/delivery services of essential goods because people were not allowed to go out and have limited activity during the pandemic. People were only allowed to go out to buy essential needs - food.</p><br>
        <p>From there, Ms. Janelyn, loves to cook and really wanted to try baking, came up with an idea to cater food and baked goods, go online and deliver foods. Thus, she named it Stove n’ Oven, since she loves to cook and bake at the same time, obviously using the stove and the oven.</p><br>
        <p>Up until now, Stove n’ Oven is still in operation at the comfort of her home…</p><br>
        <p>She caters savory food and baked goods, customize cake and cupcakes. </p>
