        <p>Stove n’ Oven - was established in 2020, during the pandemic, when almost all establishment and most companies were closed and only food and logistics businesses were left in operation since food is an essential need during that time and logistics/delivery services of essential goods because people were not allowed to go out and have limited activity during the pandemic. People were only allowed to go out to buy essential needs - food.</p><br>
        <p>From there, Ms. Janelyn, loves to cook and really wanted to try baking, came up with an idea to cater food and baked goods, go online and deliver foods. Thus, she named it Stove n’ Oven, since she loves to cook and bake at the same time, obviously using the stove and the oven. She caters savory food and baked goods, customize cake and cupcakes. She caters savory food and baked goods, customize cake and cupcakes. </p><br>
        <p>Stove n’ Oven quickly gained popularity within the local community, not just for its delicious offerings but also for its personalized touch. Ms. Janelyn's passion for cooking and baking reflected in every dish and treat she prepared, making each bite a delightful experience for her customers.</p>
